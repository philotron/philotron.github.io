Welcome to my page! I'm Phillip Schneider, Head of Natural Language Processing at the startup ALMA PHIL, where we're transforming personal healthcare with AI-powered voice assistants. I'm also in the final stage of my doctorate in computer science at the Technical University of Munich, focusing on dialogue systems and exploratory information retrieval. I've been fortunate to develop my expertise in AI through international roles, including a guest research position at the AI Research Center at AIST Tokyo and internships at leading tech companies like IBM and Amazon.
